FF6Hacking.com Sprite Database
------------------------------
version 1.0
released on 08/31/2017
compiled by madsiur


This is our sprite database, i.e. all available sprites posted on the forum since 2009.
"poses" and "previews" folders were generated automatically from the spritesheets in
"characters".

If you find any author mistake or can label the "unknow" authors, please contact me.
All credit goes to spriters specified at beginning of filename and readme.txt in each 
folder. If you want to use a sprite, please credit the author.

Some things like RotDS characters will be added and corrections made in the future so the 
archive will be updated but this was enough for a version 1.0.
